Basic simulations of the [100 prisoners problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem).

After compiling, the `./simulation n` command runs $n$ simulations, reporting the success (prisoners win) rate and creating a .txt file registering the number of the first inmate to lose the game.

The ROOT macro (`histos.C`) plots in a histogram the distribution of the first loser.
